# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Getting Started

To get started running the project locally, please follow the steps below.

First, clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/abui-am/moviedb-app
```

Then, install the dependencies. **note that we use yarn, not npm.**


```bash
cd moviedb-app
yarn install
```

Create `.env` file and put your http://www.omdbapi.comkey there with variable name `REACT_APP_OMBAPIKEY` 

```bash
REACT_APP_OMBAPIKEY=[your apikey]
```

example :
```bash
REACT_APP_OMBAPIKEY=aecbedaf
```

You can now start the development server with 
```bash
yarn start
```


Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
